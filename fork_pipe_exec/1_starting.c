/*
* fflush:
* When performing input or output operations, C often uses buffering. 
* Instead of writing data directly to the destination (like a file or the terminal) 
* every time a write is requested, the data is temporarily stored in a buffer. 
* After the buffer is filled, or under certain conditions, the data is then 
* flushed to its destination. This buffering mechanism enhances performance 
* by reducing the number of direct write or read operations.

* The fflush() function is used to force the buffer to be written (flushed)
* to the destination before the buffer is full or before a normal flush would occur.
